# LOTERÍA

## Description + Background
Lotería is bingo-like game where each player is given a 4x4 board with a random selection of 16 images (instead of numbers). Usually played in large groups, there is a one person who is the "cantador," drawing each card one at a time and announcing it to the players. There is a deck consisting of 54 images and the object of the game is to match a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. First person who calls out "Lotería" and has a complete match wins!

## How to Play
For this digital version, a user will receive a board with randomized images. The deck to draw from is to the left of the board. To draw, the user will click on the deck. With each draw, if there is a match, a small circluar icon will get placed on that selected image. The user will be playing against the computer and see who will get to "loteria" first!

## Methodology
This game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose this game because I grew up playing it and thought it would be fun to conceptualize what it could look like in a digital space. I also would be simple enough to implement because I could utilize some of the tic tac toe framework to build off. Quickly learned I was mistaken.
