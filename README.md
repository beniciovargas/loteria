# LOTERÍA

## BASIC IDEA
Lotería is a Mexican version of bingo. Each player is given a 4x4 board with a random selection of 16 images (instead of numbers). There is a deck with a corresponding 52 images on them. The object of the game is to match a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, with each draw of the deck. 

## USER STORY
For the MVP, the user will be given a board. There will be a button to click that will draw a card from the deck. If there is a match on the user's board, a small icon will get placed on top of that image on the board. The user will be playing the "house" and will try to get to "loteria" before the house.
