# LOTERÍA

## Description + Background
Lotería is bingo-like game where each player is given a 4x4 board with a random selection of 16 images (instead of numbers). Usually played in large groups, there is a one person who is the "cantador," drawing each card one at a time and announcing it to the players. There is a deck consisting of 54 images and the object of the game is to match a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. First person who calls out "Lotería" and has a complete match wins!

## How to Play?
For this digital version, a user will receive a board with randomized images. The deck to draw from is to the left of the board. To draw, the user will click on the deck. With each draw, if there is a match, a small circluar icon will get placed on that selected image. The user will be playing against the computer and see who will get to "loteria" first!

## Stetch Goals for Future Iterations(in no particular order):
* Add reset functionality
* Ability to play different modes, like brownout or a certain kind of "pozo" instead of the traditional row. 
* Adding a message area, where the user can see if the CPU has a match or not, as the game progresses. 
* Making it responsive
